# Popular Movies, Stage 1 
`Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree by Google`

## Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1. In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

You app will:

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
-Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
 - release date

## Why this Project?
To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## What Will I Learn After Stage 1?
- You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
- You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
- You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write

# Rubrics
## User Interface - Layout

  `MEETS SPECIFICATIONS`
  
- Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.
- UI contains an element (i.e a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.
- UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.
- Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.

## User Interface - Function

  `MEETS SPECIFICATIONS`
  
- When a user changes the sort criteria (“most popular and highest rated”) the main view gets updated correctly.
- When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.

## Network API Implementation

  `MEETS SPECIFICATIONS`

- In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.

## General Project Guidelines

  `MEETS SPECIFICATIONS`
- App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines (NOTE: For Stage 1 of the Popular Movies App, it is okay if the app does not restore the data using `onSaveInstanceState`/`onRestoreInstanceState`)
